### Breaking Changes
- Don't load Cart resource on non-cart pages [#1401](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/pull/1401). While the theme itself doesn't depend on
  this resource on non-cart pages, this can potentially affect any scripts added by the Script Manager or the legacy footer scripts that depend on cart.
  If this applies to you, you'll want to add the cart resource back on the page types that need it (via front matter).
