# Cornerstone
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bigcommerce/cornerstone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bigcommerce/cornerstone)

Stencil's Cornerstone theme is the building block for BigCommerce theme developers to get started quickly developing premium quality themes on the BigCommerce platform.

### Stencil Utils
[Stencil-utils](https://github.com/bigcommerce/stencil-utils) is our supporting library for our events and remote interactions.

## JS API
When writing theme JavaScript (JS) there is an API in place for running JS on a per page basis. To properly write JS for your theme, the following page types are available to you:

* "pages/account/addresses"
* "pages/account/add-address"
* "pages/account/add-return"
* "pages/account/add-wishlist"
* "pages/account/recent-items"
* "pages/account/download-item"
* "pages/account/edit"
* "pages/account/return-saved"
* "pages/account/returns"
* "pages/account/payment-methods"
* "pages/auth/login"
* "pages/auth/account-created"
* "pages/auth/create-account"
* "pages/auth/new-password"
* "pages/blog"
* "pages/blog-post"
* "pages/brand"
* "pages/brands"
* "pages/cart"
* "pages/category"
* "pages/compare"
* "pages/errors"
* "pages/gift-certificate/purchase"
* "pages/gift-certificate/balance"
* "pages/gift-certificate/redeem"
* "global"
* "pages/home"
* "pages/order-complete"
* "pages/page"
* "pages/product"
* "pages/search"
* "pages/sitemap"
* "pages/subscribed"
* "page/account/wishlist-details"
* "pages/account/wishlists"

These page types will correspond to the pages within your theme. Each one of these page types map to an ES6 module that extends the base `PageManager` abstract class.

```javascript
    export default class Auth extends PageManager {
        constructor() {
            // Set up code goes here; attach to internals and use internals as you would 'this'
        }
    }
```

### JS Template Context Injection
Occasionally you may need to use dynamic data from the template context within your client-side theme application code.

Two helpers are provided to help achieve this.

The inject helper allows you to compose a JSON object with a subset of the template context to be sent to the browser.

```
{{inject "stringBasedKey" contextValue}}
```

To retrieve the parsable JSON object, just call `{{jsContext}}` after all of the `{{@inject}}` calls.

For example, to setup the product name in your client-side app, you can do the following if you're in the context of a product:

```html
{{inject "myProductName" product.title}}

<script>
// Note the lack of quotes around the jsContext handlebars helper, it becomes a string automatically.
var jsContext = JSON.parse({{jsContext}}); // jsContext would output "{\"myProductName\": \"Sample Product\"}" which can feed directly into your JavaScript

console.log(jsContext.myProductName); // Will output: Sample Product
</script>
```

You can compose your JSON object across multiple pages to create a different set of client-side data depending on the currently loaded template context.

The stencil theme makes the jsContext available on both the active page scoped and global PageManager objects as `this.context`.


## Static assets
Some static assets in the Stencil theme are handled with Grunt if required. This
means you have some dependencies on grunt and npm. To get started:

First make sure you have Grunt installed globally on your machine:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

and run:

```
npm install
```

Note: package-lock.json file was generated by Node version 8 and npm version 6.4.1. Although the app supports Node versions 6 and 8 as well as multiple versions of npm, we should always use those versions when updating package-lock.json, unless it is decided to upgrade those, and in this case the readme should be updated as well. If using a different version for node OR npm, please delete the package-lock.json file prior to installing node packages and also prior to pushing to github.

If updating or adding a dependency, please double check that you are working on Node version 8 and npm version 6.4.1 and run ```npm update <package_name>```  or ```npm install <package_name>``` (avoid running npm install for updating a package). After updating the package, please make sure that the changes in the package-lock.json reflect only the updated/new package prior to pushing the changes to github.


### Icons
Icons are delivered via a single SVG sprite, which is embedded on the page in
`templates/layout/base.html`. It is generated via a grunt task `grunt svgstore`.

The task takes individual SVG files for each icon in `assets/icons` and bundles
them together, to be inlined on the top of the theme, via an ajax call managed
by svg-injector. Each icon can then be called in a similar way to an inline image via:

```
<svg><use xlink:href="#icon-svgFileName" /></svg>
```

The ID of the SVG icon you are calling is based on the filename of the icon you want,
with `icon-` prepended. e.g. `xlink:href="#icon-facebook"`.

Simply add your new icon SVG file to the icons folder, and run `grunt svgstore`,
or just `grunt`.
