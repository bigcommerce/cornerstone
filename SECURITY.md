# Reporting security issues
BigCommerce is dedicated to the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.
If you have found a security vulnerability in an active open-source repository created and owned by BigCommerce, please report it to our [public bug bounty program](https://bugcrowd.com/bigcommerce). If you would prefer to submit via email, please send your report to [security@bigcommerce.com](mailto:security@bigcommerce.com).

We ask that you **do not** open a public GitHub issue to report security concerns.

_Note: Only submissions to our bounty program on BugCrowd will be eligible for bounties. Bounty eligibility and amounts are determined according to the program guidelines._

_Note: Bugs in 3rd-party modules and/or dependencies should be reported to the owners/maintainers or those modules and/or dependencies, BigCommerce has no control or authority over third party content._

Thank you in advance for collaborating with us to help protect us and our customers.
