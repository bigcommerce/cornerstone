            <li>
                The wipers come with the J-hook style adapter pre-installed. This is the most common style of wiper. The included adapter kit contains pairs of adapters that account for all other vehicles. Grab one of each of the four different adapter types and compare to your vehicle. If none are a match you have a J-hook style wiper. You can simply slide the blade towards the base of the arm and it will come off. Install the new wiper in the same manner. Otherwise, follow the instructions below.
            </li>
            <li>
                If your vehicle's wiper matches an adapter in the kit uninstall the original blade as instructed by the owners manual. You'll also need to uninstall the J-hook adapter from the MITA blade first. Start by pushing up on the adapter from the bottom edge.
            </li>

                Rotate the remaining piece so that the slot is facing upwards, then apply downward pressure to pop it off.

            <li>
                Each adapter has a corresponding slot for the central pin. Slide the matching adapter onto the wiper. It takes a good amount of force to pop the adapter onto the pin. You will hear a loud click.

                Next, we'll install the blade onto the adapter. Note the locating pin on the blade, and it's corresponding slot in the adapter. Align the pin with the slot and press the two together. It takes a good amount of force to pop the adapter onto the pin. You will hear a loud click.
