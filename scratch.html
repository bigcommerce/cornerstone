        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use a plastic prying tool to pry up and remove the OEM center cap.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use an M3 hex key to remove the screw in the center of the shift knob.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the shift knob by pulling up.
            </li>
            <li>
                Install the stainless steel shift knob core onto the shifter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Align the hole on the side of the core with the flat section of the shifter shaft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use an 3/32" hex key to install the stainless steel set screw into the core and tighten.
            </li>
            <li>
                Re-install the screw removed in step two to secure the core to the shaft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slide the black acetal outer sleeve onto the core, keeping the holes aligned. The rotation of the sleeve
                does not matter, as long as the holes are aligned with the holes in the core.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the cap onto the sleeve, keeping the holes in all three parts aligned, then secure it all together
                with the six stainless steel screws using the 5/64" hex key.
            </li>
        </ol>
