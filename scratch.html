                Click-n-Drive
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Click-n-Drive system is a very popular accessory among MINI drivers, especially as our phones have
                become more and more useful in the car. Being designed by MINI themselves, the system integrates well
                with the gauge cluster providing an OEM look and feel. The system neatly folds away when not in use and
                initially held the most common devices securely.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, as phones have grown larger, the Click-n-Drive system's universal holder has become
                incompatible with most of today's devices. Further the original device holder was not the most
                convenient solution. Today We prefer magnetic attachments that offer the ultimate convenience. Our
                holders are also independent of any device size constraints and can hold just about any size of device,
                even small tablets, so as device trends change, you don't need to worry about losing compatibility.
            </p>
            <p>Each of these attachments is designed to be compatible with MINI's Click-n-Drive system. We offer a lifetime
        warranty on each attachment. In our experience, the Click-n-Drive system is not ideal for today's larger
        phones. These magnetic attachments offer wider compatibility, and a better user expeerience.</p>

                MagSafe Holder
            </h3>
            <p>
                Out of the box, this attachment is compatible with all MagSafe devices. Additionally, the holder
                comes with an adhesive backed metal ring that you can stick to a phone or case to gain compatibility
                with non-MagSafe devices. The benefit to this option for non-MagSafe devices is that wireless
                charging is still available when using the adhesive metal ring.
