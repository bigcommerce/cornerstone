    <p>This page serves as a guide to help our customers send us the information we need to develop a new Platypus License Plate Mount kit. Our original design is centered around the existence of a threaded towing eye receiver which is found on most vehicles that are manufactured outside of the US and eventually shipped here. These vehicles will include a large threaded towing eye:</p>

    <p>Our typical Platypus kit consists of two main parts: the main stud and the backplate. By developing many variations of these two parts, we can create Platypus kits that are compatible with almost any vehicle. The first step is to determine which stud your vehicle will require. To do this, we need to know the length of the towing eye as well as the diameter and shape of the threads. This can be accomplished by sending a couple photos.</p>
    <p>First, a photo of the towing eye next to a ruler or tape measure. Note that the scale should start at the threaded end of the towing eye and the entire width of the threaded section should be in view and not obscured by the measuring device. The location of the towing eye, as well as intructions for installing it, can be found in the owners manual by looking up "towing" in the index. Usually, it is found in the trunk/back of the vehicle with the spare tire, tools, or emergency kit.</p>

    <p>In order to understand the relationship between the length of the towing eye and the bumper, a photo of the towing eye installed on the vehicle is needed. This should be taken from above, preferably with a tape measure or ruler in the frame like so:</p>

    <p>Finally, it is helpful to know if there are any other considerations regarding the specific vehicle, such as parking sensors, cameras, etc... so a simple photo of the front of the car is needed. It is important that the entire vehicle is in view, particularly the fron't bumper.</p>

    <p>Once you've gathered these photos, please send them to support@cravenspeed.com and we'd be happy to help you find a mount that will work with your vehicle!</p>
